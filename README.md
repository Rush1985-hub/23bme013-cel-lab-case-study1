➤ Project Overview

This project focuses on determining the market equilibrium price of a commodity by modeling demand and supply curves as nonlinear functions and solving the resulting equation using numerical computation and graphical visualization in MATLAB.

The equilibrium price is the point where:

• The nonlinear demand relation
• The nonlinear supply relation

are simultaneously satisfied.

The study demonstrates how computational techniques can be used to analyze and solve nonlinear economic models.

-----------------------------

➤ Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

• To understand the concept of market equilibrium
• To model demand and supply as nonlinear functions of price
• To formulate the equilibrium condition
• To derive the nonlinear price equation
• To compute the equilibrium price numerically
• To visualize demand and supply curves using MATLAB

-----------------------------

➤ Problem Description

A simplified market system is considered where:

• Demand varies nonlinearly with price
• Supply varies nonlinearly with price

The goal is to determine the steady-state price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

-----------------------------

➤ Mathematical Formulation

Nonlinear Demand Function

D(p) = 100 - 5p - 0.1p^2

Where:

• Constant term → Maximum potential demand
• Linear term → Decrease of demand with price
• Quadratic term → Nonlinear demand behavior

-----------------------------

Nonlinear Supply Function

S(p) = 20 + 2p + 0.1p^2

Where:

• Constant term → Base production level
• Linear term → Increase of supply with price
• Quadratic term → Increasing marginal cost

-----------------------------

➤ Equilibrium Condition

Market equilibrium occurs when:

D(p) = S(p)

Substituting the nonlinear models:

100 - 5p - 0.1p^2 = 20 + 2p + 0.1p^2

Rearranging:

0.2p^2 + 7p - 80 = 0

This nonlinear equation governs the equilibrium price.

-----------------------------

➤ Numerical Solution Approach

Since the equilibrium equation is nonlinear, a numerical method is applied.

A price adjustment equation is defined:

\frac{dp}{dt} = -(0.2p^2 + 7p - 80)

Euler’s Method is used for iterative computation:

p_{new} = p - (0.2p^2 + 7p - 80)\Delta t

Iterations continue until convergence is achieved.

-----------------------------

➤ Methodology

The equilibrium price is determined using the following computational procedure:
	1.	Assume an initial price
	2.	Compute supply–demand imbalance
	3.	Update price using Euler’s method
	4.	Repeat iterations until convergence
	5.	Generate a range of price values
	6.	Plot nonlinear demand and supply curves
	7.	Identify equilibrium from curve intersection

-----------------------------

➤ MATLAB Implementation

The MATLAB script performs:

• Definition of nonlinear demand and supply models
• Numerical iteration using Euler’s method
• Convergence detection
• Graphical plotting of demand and supply curves
• Visualization of equilibrium behavior

-----------------------------

➤ Results

The computational analysis yields:

• Equilibrium Price ≈ 9.08 units

This value represents the price at which nonlinear demand equals nonlinear supply.

-----------------------------

➤ Graphical Interpretation

• Demand Curve → Downward sloping nonlinear curve
• Supply Curve → Upward sloping nonlinear curve
• Intersection → Market Equilibrium
